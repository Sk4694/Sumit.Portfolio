# My portfolio website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing experience. HTML forms the structure, providing the foundation for all the content. It organizes the text, images, and links on the page. CSS is responsible for the design and layout, ensuring everything looks polished and consistent. It styles fonts, colors, and spacing, creating a visually pleasing presentation.

The interactive elements are powered by JavaScript. For instance, when you click on a project, JavaScript handles the animation or transition to provide a smooth user experience. It also enables dynamic features, like contact forms and modal pop-ups. To keep the website responsive and adaptable to different devices, I've used CSS media queries to adjust the layout and design as needed.

For project filtering, JavaScript plays a crucial role. It categorizes and displays projects based on user preferences, enhancing user engagement. Additionally, the website utilizes HTML forms and JavaScript for contact functionality, allowing visitors to reach out.

The entire project is hosted on a web server, ensuring that it's accessible online. Whether you're browsing on a desktop computer or a mobile device, the website provides a seamless and engaging experience.
